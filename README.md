This project uses machine learning to predict healthcare billing costs:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned data, handled dates, and encoded categorical features.
- **Feature Engineering**: Scaled numerical data and calculated Length of Stay.
- **Modeling**: Implemented Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting.
- **Evaluation**: Measured model performance using MAE, MSE, and R-squared.
- **Deployment**: Built a Streamlit app for real-time cost predictions.

**Try the live app**: [Healthcare Cost Prediction App](https://khushis6-healthcare-cost-prediction.streamlit.app)
